# Project-researce-paper


Abstract:
This GitHub repository hosts a research project conducted by myself during the first year at IE University, Madrid. The project explores the intricate connection between organized corruption/crime and improper waste management, focusing on the socio-political-economic mechanisms that sustain this phenomenon. By analyzing the Campania region in southern Italy (plagued by the Camorra) and Sweden (known for transparency and efficient waste management), the study highlights the detrimental effects of corruption on economic growth and environmental sustainability.

Introduction:
The research delves into the global issue of improper waste disposal and its impact on public health and environmental stability. It particularly emphasizes the role of corruption in manipulating waste management policies and contracts, hindering proper waste disposal. The goal is to scrutinize the mechanisms that perpetuate the relationship between corruption and improper waste disposal and unveil how corruption manifests through funds misuse and contract manipulation.

Theoretical Framework:
The theoretical framework defines corruption as the misuse of public power for private gain. It explores how corruption infiltrates waste management policies, influences contract awards, and diverts public funds for private purposes. Weak institutions, as exemplified by the Camorra's influence in Campania, contribute to a negative cycle of health damage and environmental degradation. The theory also addresses the economic impact of corruption, discouraging innovation and large-capital investments, thus affecting public health and natural resources.

Empirical Analysis:
The empirical analysis provides evidence of corruption negatively affecting waste management in the Campania region, attributing the waste crisis to the influence of the Camorra. Conversely, the successful waste management in Sweden, with a 99% recycling rate, showcases the positive impact of good governance, transparent policies, and economic incentives.

Conclusion:
The research concludes by emphasizing the critical role corruption plays in improper waste management, leading to economic stagnation, public health risks, and environmental degradation. A comparison between Campania and Sweden illustrates the importance of different approaches to waste management, policy, and socio-economic incentives. Potential solutions include intensifying efforts to combat corruption, implementing policies encouraging waste recycling, and promoting civic education.
